# Sudden Network Slowdowns Scenario


## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

##  Scenario

The server team has noticed a significant network performance degradation on some of their older devices attached to the network in the 10.0.0.0/16 network. After ruling out external DDoS attacks, the security team suspects something might be going on internally.

##  Hypothesis based on threat intelligence and security gaps

All traffic originating from within the local network is by default allowed by all hosts. There is also unrestricted use of PowerShell and other applications in the environment. Itâ€™s possible someone is either downloading large files or doing some kind of port scanning against hosts in the local network.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Inspecting the logs for excessive successful/failed connections from any devices.  

"windows-target-1" was found failing several connection requests against itself and another host on the same network:

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| summarize ConnectionCount = count()by DeviceName, ActionType, LocalIP
| order by ConnectionCount
```

### 2. Investigate the failed connection logs

After observing failed connection request from a suspected host (10.0.0.5) in chronological order, I noticed a port scan was taking place due to the sequential order of the port.There were several port scans being conducted.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
let IPInQuestion = "10.0.0.5";
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where ActionType == "ConnectionFailed"
| where LocalIP == IPInQuestion
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 3. Check out the log event for the port scan 

I pivoted to the DeviceProccessEvent table to see if we could see anything that was suspicious around the time the port scan started.We noticed a PowerShell script named portscan.ps1  launching at:2025-03-11T04:37:00.5366227Z

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
let VMName = "windows-target-1";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-03-11T04:43:48.5646128Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 10m) .. (specificTime + 10m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
| project Timestamp, FileName, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
```

### 4. Investigate the suspect

I logged into the suspect computer and observed the powershell script that was used to conduct port scan.

## Response Action
We observed the port scan script was launched by the SYSTEM account,this is not expected behavior and is not something that was setup by the admins,so I isolated the device and ran a malware scan.The malware scan produced no result , so out of cation,we kept the device isolated and put in a ticket to have it re-imagine/rebuild.
