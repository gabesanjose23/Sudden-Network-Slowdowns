# Sudden Network Slowdowns Scenario


## Platforms and Languages Leveraged
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

##  Scenario

The server team has noticed a significant network performance degradation on some of their older devices attached to the network in the 10.0.0.0/16 network. After ruling out external DDoS attacks, the security team suspects something might be going on internally.
---
##  Hypothesis based on threat intelligence and security gaps

All traffic originating from within the local network is by default allowed by all hosts. There is also unrestricted use of PowerShell and other applications in the environment. It’s possible someone is either downloading large files or doing some kind of port scanning against hosts in the local network.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Find out how long it's been exposed to the internet 

Windows-target-1 has been internet facing for several days.Last internet facing time: 2025-03-10T18:28:06.2983018Z

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceInfo
| where DeviceName == "network-slowdow"
|where IsInternetFacing == true
| order by Timestamp desc

```

### 2. Find out if anyone has attempted to login into the machine

Several bad actor have been discovered attempting to login into the Target machine.

**Query used to locate event:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
|where DeviceName == "windows-target-1"
| where LogonType has_any("Network", "Interactive", "RemoteInteractive", "Unlock")
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
| where isnotempty(RemoteIP)
| summarize Attempts = count() by ActionType, RemoteIP, DeviceName
| order by Attempts
```

---

### 3. Check if any of the bad actor where able to login

The top 10 most failed login attempts IP addresses have not been able to successfully break into the VM

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
let RemoteIPsInQuestion = dynamic(["128.1.44.9", "178.20.129.235", "83.118.125.238", "106.246.239.179", "85.215.149.156", "146.196.63.17", "89.232.41.74", "190.5.100.193", "178.176.229.228"]);
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType has_any("Network", "Interactive", "RemoteInteractive", "Unlock")
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
| where RemoteIP has_any(RemoteIPsInQuestion)
```

---

### 4. Check who dose have access to the account

The only successful remote/network logons in the last 7 days was for the ‘labuser’ account (6 total)

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType =="Network"
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess"
|where DeviceName =="windows-target-1"
|where AccountName == ”labuser”
```
<img width="1212" alt="image" src="Screenshot 2025-03-10 145153.png">

---
### 5. Check if labuser has any suspicious failed login attemps 

There were (0) failed logons for the ‘labuser’ account,indicating that a brute force attempts for this account didn’t take place,and a 1-time password guess is unlikely.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType =="Network"
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"
|where DeviceName =="windows-target-1"
|where AccountName == "labuser"
```
<img width="1212" alt="image" src="Screenshot 2025-03-10 145659.png">

---

### 6. Check if the location from which is being logon from is normal

We checked all of the successful login IP addresses for the “labuser” account to see if any of them were unusual or from an unexpected location,All were normal.

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
DeviceLogonEvents
| where LogonType =="Network"
| where ActionType == "LogonSuccess" 
|where DeviceName =="windows-target-1"
|where AccountName == "labuser"
| summarize loginCount = count() by DeviceName,ActionType,AccountName,RemoteIP
```

---

## Summary

Though the device was exposed to the internet and clear brute force attempts have taken place, there is no evidence of any brute force success or unauthorized access from the legitimate account “labuser”.

MITRE ATT&CK - T1078: Valid Accounts

MITRE ATT&CK - T1110: Brute Force

## Response Action

--Hardened the NSG attached to “windows-target-1” to allow only RDP traffic from specific end-points(no public internet access)

--Implemented account lockout policy

--Implement MFA
